# nvim

This is my personal Neovim configuration built on top of the
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) starter template.

## About

I like to open-source my configurations in the hope that they might help others
set up their own Neovim environment. Feel free to use this as reference or
inspiration for your own setup!
